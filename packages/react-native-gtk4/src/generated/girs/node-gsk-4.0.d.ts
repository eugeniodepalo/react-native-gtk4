  /**
   * A `GskGLShader` is a snippet of GLSL that is meant to run in the
   * fragment shader of the rendering pipeline.
   *
   * A fragment shader gets the coordinates being rendered as input and
   * produces the pixel values for that particular pixel. Additionally,
   * the shader can declare a set of other input arguments, called
   * uniforms (as they are uniform over all the calls to your shader in
   * each instance of use). A shader can also receive up to 4
   * textures that it can use as input when producing the pixel data.
   *
   * `GskGLShader` is usually used with gtk_snapshot_push_gl_shader()
   * to produce a [class`Gsk`.GLShaderNode] in the rendering hierarchy,
   * and then its input textures are constructed by rendering the child
   * nodes to textures before rendering the shader node itself. (You can
   * pass texture nodes as children if you want to directly use a texture
   * as input).
   *
   * The actual shader code is GLSL code that gets combined with
   * some other code into the fragment shader. Since the exact
   * capabilities of the GPU driver differs between different OpenGL
   * drivers and hardware, GTK adds some defines that you can use
   * to ensure your GLSL code runs on as many drivers as it can.
   *
   * If the OpenGL driver is GLES, then the shader language version
   * is set to 100, and GSK_GLES will be defined in the shader.
   *
   * Otherwise, if the OpenGL driver does not support the 3.2 core profile,
   * then the shader will run with language version 110 for GL2 and 130 for GL3,
   * and GSK_LEGACY will be defined in the shader.
   *
   * If the OpenGL driver supports the 3.2 code profile, it will be used,
   * the shader language version is set to 150, and GSK_GL3 will be defined
   * in the shader.
   *
   * The main function the shader must implement is:
   *
   * ```glsl
   *  void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
   *                 in vec2 fragCoord,
   *                 in vec2 resolution,
   *                 in vec2 uv)
   * ```
   *
   * Where the input `fragCoord` is the coordinate of the pixel we're
   * currently rendering, relative to the boundary rectangle that was
   * specified in the `GskGLShaderNode`, and `resolution` is the width and
   * height of that rectangle. This is in the typical GTK coordinate
   * system with the origin in the top left. `uv` contains the u and v
   * coordinates that can be used to index a texture at the
   * corresponding point. These coordinates are in the [0..1]x[0..1]
   * region, with 0, 0 being in the lower left corder (which is typical
   * for OpenGL).
   *
   * The output `fragColor` should be a RGBA color (with
   * premultiplied alpha) that will be used as the output for the
   * specified pixel location. Note that this output will be
   * automatically clipped to the clip region of the glshader node.
   *
   * In addition to the function arguments the shader can define
   * up to 4 uniforms for textures which must be called u_textureN
   * (i.e. u_texture1 to u_texture4) as well as any custom uniforms
   * you want of types int, uint, bool, float, vec2, vec3 or vec4.
   *
   * All textures sources contain premultiplied alpha colors, but if some
   * there are outer sources of colors there is a gsk_premultiply() helper
   * to compute premultiplication when needed.
   *
   * Note that GTK parses the uniform declarations, so each uniform has to
   * be on a line by itself with no other code, like so:
   *
   * ```glsl
   * uniform float u_time;
   * uniform vec3 u_color;
   * uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
   * uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
   * ```
   *
   * GTK uses the "gsk" namespace in the symbols it uses in the
   * shader, so your code should not use any symbols with the prefix gsk
   * or GSK. There are some helper functions declared that you can use:
   *
   * ```glsl
   * vec4 GskTexture(sampler2D sampler, vec2 texCoords);
   * ```
   *
   * This samples a texture (e.g. u_texture1) at the specified
   * coordinates, and contains some helper ifdefs to ensure that
   * it works on all OpenGL versions.
   *
   * You can compile the shader yourself using [method`Gsk`.GLShader.compile],
   * otherwise the GSK renderer will do it when it handling the glshader
   * node. If errors occurs, the returned `error` will include the glsl
   * sources, so you can see what GSK was passing to the compiler. You
   * can also set GSK_DEBUG=shaders in the environment to see the sources
   * and other relevant information about all shaders that GSK is handling.
   *
   * # An example shader
   *
   * ```glsl
   * uniform float position;
   * uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
   * uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
   *
   * void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
   *                in vec2 fragCoord,
   *                in vec2 resolution,
   *                in vec2 uv) {
   *   vec4 source1 = GskTexture(u_texture1, uv);
   *   vec4 source2 = GskTexture(u_texture2, uv);
   *
   *   fragColor = position * source1 + (1.0 - position) * source2;
   * }
   * ```
